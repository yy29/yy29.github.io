I am currently a researcher and team leader at the research lab of Kioxia Corporation. My main research areas are basic & applied research in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Memory System and Natural Language Processing. I am particularly interested in the intersection of memory and intelligence. I have co-authored more than 30 research articles and patents.
