I am currently a researcher and team leader at the research lab of Kioxia Corporation, Japan. My main research areas are basic & applied research in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Memory System and Natural Language Processing. I am particularly interested in the intersection of memory and intelligence. I have co-authored more than 30 research articles and patents. I have been serving as a reviewer at ACL Rolling Review, WACV, ACL, EMNLP and others. I am also a Senior Member of IEEE.
