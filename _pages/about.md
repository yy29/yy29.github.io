Hi I'm Youyang. I am an experienced industry researcher focusing on basic and applied studies in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Memory System, with track record in patents, publications, and industrial implementations. Currently, I lead a deep learning research team at Kioxia Corporation, Japan. My research interests lie in the intersection and interaction of memory, intelligence, and perception in vision and language models.

I have co-authored over 40 patents and research articles, including publications in notable venues such as ECCV, ACCV and EMNLP. Additionally, I have served as a reviewer for venues including ACL Rolling Review, ICCV, WACV, BMVC, ACL, EMNLP and NAACL. I have received outstanding reviewer recognition at EMNLP. I am also a Senior Member of IEEE. I have over 14 years of industrial R&D experiences, including roles at Kioxia and Toshiba Corporation in Japan, and hold a B.Eng from Universiti Malaya, Malaysia. The tools I helped develop inspect and analyze millions of visual data daily in social infrastructure & semiconductor industries. I speak English, Japanese, Chinese and Malay.
