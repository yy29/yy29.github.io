Hi I'm Youyang. I am currently a researcher and team leader at the research lab of Kioxia Corporation, Japan. My main research focuses are basic & applied research in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Memory System. I am particularly interested in the intersection of memory, intelligence, and alignment in vision and language models. 

I have co-authored over 30 patents and research articles including publications at ECCV, ACCV, EMNLP and others. I have been serving as a reviewer at ACL Rolling Review, WACV, ACL, EMNLP and others. I have received outstanding reviewer recognition at EMNLP. I am also a Senior Member of IEEE. I have over 14 years of industrial R&D experiences, previously worked at Toshiba Corporation, and hold a B.Eng from Universiti Malaya, Malaysia. I speak English, Japanese, Chinese and Malay.
